# Boomermath.gq
A stylish and sleek proxy website made using TitaniumNetwork's proxies!

## Deployment:
This website can be deployed on a static service (like Netlify/Vercel) or uploaded to web hosting!

## Development:
I am constantly trying to make my site better, so expect new commits!


## For ppl who fork this:
This is just a frontend! The proxies are externally hosted! If you want to attach your own proxies (instead of mooching off of mine) go to js/surf.js and change the domain variables.

## Credits:
TitaniumNetwork - for developing these amazing proxies!

VantaJS - for the super-cool background!
