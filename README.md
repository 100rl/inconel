# Inconel.ml
A stylish and sleek proxy website made using TitaniumNetwork's proxies!

## Deployment:
This website can be deployed on a static service (like Netlify/Vercel) or uploaded to web hosting!

## Development:
I am constantly trying to make my site better, so expect new commits!

## For ppl who fork this:
This is just a frontend! The proxies are externally hosted! You have to attach your own proxies (or use my site https://inconel.ml) in js/surf.js (domain variables).

```javascript
var domainPY = ""; //Pydodge
var domainPHP = ""; //PHP proxy
var domainCNN = ""; //CNN proxy
var domainAL = ""; //Alloy proxy
```

## Chat/Forum
Go to forumpages, and if you want to hook up your own chat or forum, change the iframe source.

## Credits:
TitaniumNetwork - for developing these amazing proxies!

VantaJS - for the super-cool background!
